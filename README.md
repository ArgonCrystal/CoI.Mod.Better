# Captain of Industry mod: Better

Game Version(Comptability): 0.3.8 + 0.3.8a

Savegame Comptability: You need to start a new game!

# Current overview of the functions:
- All vanilla storages have 3x more space. 
- The liquid stores have 30x more than the vanilla building.
- The refugee system has been overhauled so that refugees are now arriving forever. However, the rhythm has been changed, the number of refugees varies, the gift amounts are now also randomly generated and it can also happen that you do not receive any gifts. The number of refugees and the gifts increase at the beginning and stop increasing after a certain limit, but these can also fluctuate strongly.
- More edict have been added that offer your load amount of trucks, their consumption and their maintenance more slopes.
- You can now increase your vehicle limit with further research. However, it may happen that the performance suffers. 
- The range of your mining tower has been increased by 50%.

# Cheats:
- The cheats will only be available in the separate mod. 

- There is now the possibility to activate a cheat via research that allows you to increase your vehicle limit by 250. ATTENTION: There can be performance problems when the limit is fully used.

- In addition, it is possible to decrease/increase the load amount of the trucks, the maintenance and the diesel consumption. But you have to research it first and activate it with the captain's office.

# Bugs
- The new storage size is not displayed in the research tree. However, after researching the building has the modded size.
